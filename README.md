Distributed Hash Table

Implementation of a distributed hash table

----- BUILDING -----
This program depends on ASIO which must be checked out in a parallel directory to this one.

Move above this repository, and use the following command to check out asio:
git clone https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio.git -b asio-1-10-branch

Resulting directory structure:
* asio\asio\include
* dht\README.md
